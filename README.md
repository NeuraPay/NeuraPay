# 🧠 NeuraPay

> “Where Intelligence Meets Money.”

NeuraPay is an experimental **autonomous payment protocol** that allows AI agents to send, receive, and verify crypto transactions using the **x402 standard**.

Built for the **Machine Economy** — where agents, apps, and networks can transact **without human intervention.**

---

## ⚡ Overview

NeuraPay introduces an **AI-native payment layer** powered by **x402**.  
It enables intelligent systems to request, charge, and verify payments autonomously — forming the foundation for the **autonomous financial layer of AI.**

---

## 💎 Core Features

- 🧠 **AI-Native SDKs** — for Python and JavaScript.  
- 🤖 **Autonomous Transactions** — agents can pay and get paid automatically.  
- 🔗 **x402 Protocol** — a communication standard for decentralized payments.  
- 🧩 **Modular Design** — integrates easily with dApps, wallets, and APIs.  
- 🌐 **Cross-Agent Support** — enables direct “agent-to-agent” payments.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 🐍 Python SDK

Install via pip:

```bash
pip install neurapay

# Example Usage (Python)
from neurapay import Client

client = Client(api_key="your-api-key")

payment = client.create_payment(
    recipient="agent_0xA12F...",
    amount=0.42,
    currency="SOL",
    memo="AI-to-AI transaction"
)

print(payment.status)
```


#  🧩 JavaScript SDK (Beta)
npm install neurapay

#Example Usage:
```import { NeuraPay } from "neurapay";

const client = new NeuraPay("your-api-key");

const payment = await client.createPayment({
  recipient: "agent_0xA12F...",
  amount: 0.42,
  currency: "SOL",
  memo: "AI-to-AI transaction"
});

console.log(payment.status);
```

# 🧠 How It Works
    1. Agents connect to NeuraPay via SDKs or APIs.
    2. Transactions are encoded in the x402 protocol for AI-native interoperability.
    3. Smart validation ensures each payment is verified autonomously.
    4. Results are returned in real-time to connected agents.
